Hello!

Welcome to SGA!  By taking this first step, you are well on your way to creating a better UMBC for all undergraduate students.  In addition to this message, you should have received three things:

	• Registration information to Basecamp -- our internal project management tool.
	• Registration information for Slack -- our internal communication tool.
	• Addition to the SGA internal e-mail list (sga@lists.umbc.edu).

As an active member of the organization, your name, e-mail address, bio, "fun fact" has also been added to the public side of the SGA Initiative Tracker.  You can view your profile and the profiles for all members of the organization here: http://apps.sga.umbc.edu/itracker/people/by-name/.  If you would like to change any of your information at any time, feel free to do so by using the link in the upper left hand corner of the iTracker website (http://apps.sga.umbc.edu/itracker/).

Again, welcome to the organization!  I look forward to working with you over the course of this academic year.

All the Best,
Josh Massey (joshua.massey@umbc.edu)
